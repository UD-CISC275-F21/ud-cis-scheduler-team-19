I'd like to be able to quickly build a schedule for a student and potentially authorize course substitutions, as not all courses are offered every year and every semester.

User Story: Jenny (Senior)
I'm all set to graduate this year, and just want to take a fun computer science class that pertains to my area of expertise, regardless of meeting a requirement. I would like short descriptions of each class to quickly identify which one I'd like to take.

I've switched into the major a year late and don't have as many requirements satisfied as my peers. Can you help me see what classes I can take simultaneously to still graduate on time?

User Story: Jane (High Schooler)
My name is Jane, and I'm a prospective student of UD currently still in high school. I'd like to use the planner to determine if there's a line of course's I'd like to take at the university that applies to what I want to learn. My main barrier is that I don't have an advisor and don't know what I'm doing! Please make it very self-explanatory for me.
